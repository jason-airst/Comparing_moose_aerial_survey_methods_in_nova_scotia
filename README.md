## Suplimentary Materials
#
## List of files:
### 1) R_code -> An R markdown file that contains the code use to carry out the analysis in the paper
### 2) Distance_2020 -> Distance sampling data used to generate moose estimates via traditional distance sampling. Data also used to generate detection curves for density surface models
### 3) Seg_2020 -> Distance sampling segment data used to generate moose estimates via a density surface models
### 4) Obs_2020 -> Distance sampling observation data used to generate moose estimates via a density surface model
### 5) Pred_2020 -> 1 km^2 grid of study area used to generate moose estimates from the density surface model created
### 6) Trans_2020 -> Transect flight data used to stratify survey units into low, medium, or high density strata as part of the stratified random block survey
### 7) Strat_2020 -> Statification flight data used to generate moose estimates via stratified random block survey method
### 8) Intensive_2020 -> Intensive statification flight data used to generate sightability correction factors for the stratified random block survey method
